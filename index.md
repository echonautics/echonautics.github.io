Hi. Im probably going to ne in a bit of a mood so im mot going to say much of anything other than
that I  a mathematics fanatic, theory crafter, and game developer
 I am like totally obsessed with Chinese designed gaming systems and the numbers involved with your stats
is something that I study in great detail. Please, it took me a long time to farm up the T6 and T7 gear.
It has been getting harder and harder to come across...

I had set to the side so I could make some room for the very limited space I am working with here and for me to
Over what is least important. What perccentages do we run into the diminishing return. Etc etc..
This way I will be able to find the numbers we would want to minimize and maximize stat allocations.
To eventually Kick some ass like no other. Probsbly rarely seen in games but..have you've ever seen some low level come
in with low power and just one hit your top player? Then everyone cries to the game masters about "this hacker"
Destroyubg everyone whpm gets too close to them? Then a week later, the player files are analysed.
Idk, its not often tou ryn run into people like me but i pkan to be able to take ohy whalws like Zeec with
Little to np effort and jt takes a.lkt of math to get there.

So, if you guys could help me by depositing every t6/t7 that your run actoss I would be highly 
appreciate it. Now, knoeing that you guys couldn't  possinly even know what I was doing 
And that yall were just bekng helpful... I sjould have said skmetukg porior bjt thags npt where
My head was at in the moment. I was probably debugging a provlem in software in my mind
That is ckmpletely hnrelatrd to the gamjng industry at yhe dame time writjng out a fotmula
That I am trying to derermine exactly what Sunder is and how it works

So, I tealmy cant say anything because I will regret it. I am mad at myself, not you guys,
You guys did nothing wrong. Trying to help is nwvwr a wrong thing  bjt I am frealkingnojssex the FUCK off
right now so just give me a lil tkme and space please. Thaml you..

-Meow
