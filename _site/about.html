<div class="home"><h1 class="page-heading">About</h1><p>Welcome to Illuminatus by Echonautica Designs.</p>

<p>This is created for learning purposes and publishing my artwork.
Eventually this will be where I will publish the webapp and process sales for my clothing line that is currently in progress of creation.</p>

<p>This website was created and compiled with Jekyll.</p>
