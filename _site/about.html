<p>Hi. Im probably going to ne in a bit of a mood so im mot going to say much of anything other than</p>
<p>that I  a mathematics fanatic, theory crafter, and game developer</p>
<p> I am like totally obsessed with Chinese designed gaming systems and the numbers involved with your stats</p>
<p>is something that I study in great detail. Please, it took me a long time to farm up the T6 and T7 gear.</p>
<p>It has been getting harder and harder to come across...</p>

<p>I had set to the side so I could make some room for the very limited space I am working with here and for me to</p>
<>learm the finer details of how some of these stats work. I am trying to determine what is important</p>
<>over what is least important. What perccentages do we run into the diminishing return. Etc etc..</p>
<>This way I will be able to find the numbers we would want to minimize and maximize stat allocations. </p>
<p>To eventually Kick some ass like no other. Probsbly rarely seen in games but..have you've ever seen some low level come</p>
<p>in with low power and just one hit your top player? Then everyone cries to the game masters about "this hacker"</p>
<p>Destroyubg everyone whpm gets too close to them? Then a week later, the player files are analysed.</p>
<p>Idk, its not often tou ryn run into people like me but i pkan to be able to take ohy whalws like Zeec with</p>
<p>Little to np effort and jt takes a.lkt of math to get there.

<p>So, if you guys could help me by depositing every t6/t7 that your run actoss I would be highly </p>
<p>appreciate it. Now, knoeing that you guys couldn't  possinly even know what I was doing </p>
<p>And that yall were just bekng helpful... I sjould have said skmetukg porior bjt thags npt where</p>
<p>My head was at in the moment. I was probably debugging a provlem in software in my mind</p>
<p>That is ckmpletely hnrelatrd to the gamjng industry at yhe dame time writjng out a fotmula</p>
<p>That I am trying to derermine exactly what Sunder is and how it works</p>

<p>So, I tealmy cant say anything because I will regret it. I am mad at myself, not you guys,</p>
<p>You guys did nothing wrong. Trying to help is nwvwr a wrong thing  bjt I am frealkingnojssex the FUCK off</p>
<p>right now so just give me a lil tkme and space please. Thaml you..</p>

<p>-Meow</p>
